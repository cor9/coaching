<h1>Darren Jones Audition Preparation Guide<br>
"Straw Town" - Crime Drama Feature Film</h1>

<div class="highlight-box">
<p><strong>Listen up:</strong> Darren isn't just another "awkward teenager." He's your chance to show casting that you can carry the weight of an entire film on your shoulders while making trauma feel heartbreakingly real.</p>
</div>

<h2>1. PROJECT OVERVIEW</h2>

<div class="highlight-box">
<p><strong>Project Type:</strong> Feature Film</p>
<p><strong>Genre:</strong> Crime Drama</p>
<p><strong>Tone & Style:</strong> Gritty, emotional, dark with moments of teenage awkwardness. Think "Fargo" meets "Stand By Me" with elements of "Winter's Bone." This isn't glossy Hollywood drama—it's raw, authentic, and demands complete emotional honesty.</p>
<p><strong>Scene Context:</strong> Set in 1980s rural Indiana. These scenes follow Darren as he navigates family dynamics after his father's death, dealing with his manipulative mother, protecting his younger brother, and eventually confessing his deepest trauma to his grandmother.</p>
</div>

<div class="warning-box">
<p><strong>Real Talk:</strong> This is LEAD material. They're looking for someone who can anchor an entire film. Darren appears in almost every scene, so they need to believe you can carry that emotional weight for 90+ minutes.</p>
</div>

<h2>2. CHARACTER BREAKDOWN</h2>

<h3>Who is Darren? (The Real Version)</h3>
<p>Darren is a 16-19 year old late bloomer caught between childhood and a brutal adult reality. He's lanky, awkward, and the type who might blend into the background of a John Hughes movie—except this isn't a John Hughes movie. This is a kid processing potential involvement in his father's death while trying to protect his younger brother from their mother's manipulations.</p>

<div class="highlight-box">
<h3>How He Sees Himself:</h3>
<p>The responsible one. The protector. The keeper of terrible secrets. Darren feels burdened by knowledge and responsibilities way beyond his years. He sees himself as caught between wanting normal teenage experiences and dealing with adult moral complexities.</p>

<h3>How Others See Him:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Jeffery (brother):</strong> Bossy, annoying, but ultimately protective</li>
<li><strong>Evelyn (grandmother):</strong> Sees his pain and emotional depth that others miss</li>
<li><strong>Mother:</strong> Someone she can manipulate and control</li>
<li><strong>Generally:</strong> The type who gets overlooked, blends into the background</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3>Your Bridge to Darren (Find Your Connection):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Ever felt responsible for a younger sibling?</li>
<li>Ever had to keep family secrets that felt too heavy?</li>
<li>Ever felt caught between childhood and adulthood?</li>
<li>Ever felt invisible or overlooked by peers?</li>
<li>Ever had a complicated relationship with a parent?</li>
</ul>

<div class="coach-note">
<p><strong>Character Shortcut:</strong> Think of Darren as River Phoenix in "Stand By Me" if he'd been forced to pull the trigger. All that quiet observation and emotional intelligence, but carrying the weight of actual violence.</p>
</div>

<h2>3. SCENE BREAKDOWN</h2>

<div class="scene-box">
<h3>Scene 1: The Deflection</h3>
<p><strong>What Darren is Actually DOING:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Defending his brother:</strong> "He didn't beat me up!" - protecting Jeffery from judgment</li>
<li><strong>Managing information:</strong> Controlling what Evelyn knows about family dynamics</li>
<li><strong>Creating distance:</strong> Physical and emotional withdrawal when overwhelmed</li>
<li><strong>Testing loyalties:</strong> Watching the dynamic between Jeffery and Evelyn</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key Physical Moment:</strong> The walk out of the room. This isn't just leaving—it's self-preservation.</p>
</div>

<div class="scene-box">
<h3>Scene 2: The Escape Plan</h3>
<p><strong>What Darren is Actually DOING:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Seeking normalcy:</strong> Getting ready for a party, trying to be a regular teenager</li>
<li><strong>Playful interaction:</strong> The pinching of Jeffery shows their real relationship beneath the tension</li>
<li><strong>Asserting control:</strong> Taking the beer and crushing it—showing dominance and concern</li>
<li><strong>Negotiating:</strong> Making deals to protect both their secrets</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Physical Gold:</strong> The contrast between preparing for social interaction and dealing with private family dysfunction.</p>
</div>

<div class="scene-box">
<h3>Scene 3: The Unburdening</h3>
<p><strong>What Darren is Actually DOING:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Resisting connection:</strong> Pacing, unable to sit still initially</li>
<li><strong>Processing trauma:</strong> Using the dog story as a metaphor for his situation</li>
<li><strong>Seeking understanding:</strong> Finally allowing Evelyn to see his pain</li>
<li><strong>Accepting comfort:</strong> Allowing physical connection at the end</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Revelation:</strong> This isn't just storytelling—it's therapy through metaphor.</p>
</div>

<h2>4. SUBTEXT & EMOTIONAL LAYERS</h2>

<h3>What He's REALLY Saying:</h3>

<div class="highlight-box">
<p><strong>"He didn't beat me up!"</strong><br>
<em>Real meaning:</em> "Don't focus on me or what's happened to me. I can't handle scrutiny right now."</p>

<p><strong>"Mom is going to go nuts if she knew she was here."</strong><br>
<em>Real meaning:</em> "I'm terrified of my mother and the consequences. You don't understand how dangerous this is."</p>

<p><strong>"You're not my responsibility."</strong><br>
<em>Real meaning:</em> "I'm overwhelmed by responsibility and can't take any more. This is my breaking point."</p>
</div>

<h3>The Emotional Journey:</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Scene 1:</strong> Defensive → Protective → Overwhelmed → Withdrawal</li>
<li><strong>Scene 2:</strong> Determined escape → Playful brother moment → Authoritative concern → Mutual antagonism (that hides love)</li>
<li><strong>Scene 3:</strong> Resistance → Exhausted surrender → Vulnerable storytelling → Accepted comfort</li>
</ol>

<h2>5. BOLD CHOICES THAT BOOK JOBS</h2>

<div class="warning-box">
<p><strong>Scene 1 - The Trap vs. The Truth:</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Trap:</strong> Playing Darren as just "moody teenager" for the entire scene.</p>
<p><strong>The Truth:</strong> Darren cycles through multiple emotional states—defensive, protective, overwhelmed, strategic.</p>
</div>

<h3>Surprising Shifts to Try:</h3>

<p><strong>Scene 1:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Vocal Choice:</strong> Start with teenage defensiveness, then shift to adult-level concern about mother</li>
<li><strong>Physical Surprise:</strong> When saying "You're not my responsibility," try it with exhausted resignation rather than anger</li>
<li><strong>Emotional Risk:</strong> Let us see a flash of genuine fear when mentioning mom</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Scene 2:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unexpected Playfulness:</strong> The pinching of Jeffery should feel like real brotherly affection beneath the antagonism</li>
<li><strong>Authority Shift:</strong> When taking the beer, show both dominance AND genuine concern</li>
<li><strong>Contradiction:</strong> "Hate you too" can be said with underlying love</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Scene 3:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Storytelling Evolution:</strong> Start the dog story matter-of-factly, then let emotion gradually seep in</li>
<li><strong>Physical Vulnerability:</strong> The moment you finally turn to Evelyn should feel like breaking down a wall</li>
<li><strong>Silent Power:</strong> Use the pause after "And you want to know what?" to let us feel the weight</li>
</ul>

<div class="coach-note">
<p><strong>Bold Choice Alert:</strong> What if, during the dog story, there's a moment where Darren gets lost in the memory and for a second, he's that younger kid working alongside his father? Then reality crashes back. That kind of shift shows range and depth.</p>
</div>

<h2>6. YOUR ACTION PLAN</h2>

<div class="highlight-box">
<ul>
<li>☐ Read each scene 5 times, marking every emotional shift and objective</li>
<li>☐ Practice the physicality of carrying emotional weight—how does trauma live in YOUR body?</li>
<li>☐ Work on the transitions—defensive to vulnerable, playful to serious</li>
<li>☐ Master the dog story—practice building from matter-of-fact to emotional revelation</li>
<li>☐ Find YOUR version of Darren's observation style—he watches before he acts</li>
<li>☐ Practice the beer can moment in Scene 2—dominance mixed with genuine concern</li>
<li>☐ Nail the final moment of Scene 3—how does YOUR Darren accept comfort?</li>
<li>☐ Record a practice run, watch it back, then try completely different approaches</li>
<li>☐ Remember: You're not just playing scenes—you're auditioning to carry an entire film</li>
<li>☐ <strong>Most Important:</strong> Find the love beneath all the dysfunction</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="coach-note">
<p><strong>Final Pep Talk:</strong> This isn't just another "troubled teen" role. This is your chance to show that you can handle complex, morally ambiguous material with the depth and authenticity it requires. Darren isn't a victim—he's a survivor making impossible choices. That resilience underneath the vulnerability? That's your secret weapon. Now go show them a Darren they'll never forget.</p>
